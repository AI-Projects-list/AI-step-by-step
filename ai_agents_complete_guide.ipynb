    "## Topic 1 — What are AI Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "An AI agent is a software entity that:\n",
    "- **Perceives** its environment (sensors, inputs, API responses, user queries)\n",
    "- **Maintains state** (memory, internal models, conversation history)\n",
    "- **Reasons or plans** what to do next (symbolic planners, RL policies, LLM-based reasoning)\n",
    "- **Acts** to achieve goals (calls tools, APIs, writes outputs, updates databases)\n",
    "- **Learns** and adapts over time (optional, but often valuable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components\n",
    "1. **Perception Layer**: Sensors, API clients, event listeners, input parsing\n",
    "2. **Memory**: Short-term (current context), long-term (history, learned patterns)\n",
    "3. **Reasoning/Planning Engine**: Decides next action (rule-based, heuristic search, LLM, RL policy)\n",
    "4. **Tool Executor**: Runs tools, APIs, handles side effects safely\n",
    "5. **Tools/Actuators**: External capabilities (web search, calculator, database, API calls, file I/O)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use AI Agents?\n",
    "✅ **Automate multi-step workflows**: Chain tool calls together (search → summarize → email)  \n",
    "✅ **Complex reasoning**: Decompose tasks, plan sequences, adapt to errors  \n",
    "✅ **Maintain context**: Remember history, manage conversation state  \n",
    "✅ **Safe external tool access**: Control what tools agents can call, audit all actions  \n",
    "✅ **Scalable orchestration**: Coordinate multiple systems (APIs, databases, services)  \n",
    "✅ **Error recovery**: Agents can retry, backtrack, or escalate when stuck  \n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to Use Agents\n",
    "❌ Simple single-turn queries (direct LLM call is faster)  \n",
    "❌ Real-time latency-critical systems (<100ms response required)  \n",
    "❌ No external tool access needed (overhead of orchestration not justified)  \n",
    "❌ Fully deterministic logic (traditional software is simpler, auditable)  \n",
    "❌ Highly sensitive operations without proven safety (use with caution or on-premise only)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Risks & Mitigations\n",
    "| Risk | Mitigation |\n",
    "|------|-----------|\n",
    "| Hallucinations | Use retrieval, tool verification, validators |\n",
    "| Untrusted tool calls | Sandbox tools, require explicit authorization |\n",
    "| Privacy leakage | Enforce memory retention policies, redaction |\n",
    "| Cost explosion | Cache results, limit tool calls, use cheaper models |\n",
    "| Infinite loops | Set max iterations, timeouts, circuit breakers |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples\n",
    "- **Customer Support Bot**: Routes to appropriate tools (FAQ search, ticket creation, escalation)\n",
    "- **Research Assistant**: Searches papers, summarizes findings, cites sources\n",
    "- **Code Assistant**: Reads codebase, runs tests, suggests fixes\n",
    "- **Personal Assistant**: Schedules meetings, sends emails, summarizes news\n",
    "- **DevOps Automation**: Deploys code, monitors systems, triggers alerts"

    "## Topic 2 — Agent Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Reactive Agents (Reflex Agents)\n",
    "**How it works**: Map percepts directly to actions via condition-action rules.  \n",
    "**Latency**: Very fast (milliseconds)  \n",
    "**Complexity**: Simple, no state needed  \n",
    "**When to use**: \n",
    "- Real-time control (robotics, games)\n",
    "- Microservices with immediate responses\n",
    "- Safety-critical systems (fast fallback)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: Fast, predictable, easy to understand  \n",
    "**Cons**: No planning, no learning, limited to reflex behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Deliberative Agents (Planning Agents)\n",
    "**How it works**: Build internal model, use search/optimization to plan action sequences.  \n",
    "**Latency**: Slower (seconds to minutes), depends on planning complexity  \n",
    "**Complexity**: High, requires domain modeling  \n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "- Multi-step tasks (assembly, scheduling)\n",
    "- Constraint satisfaction (resource allocation)\n",
    "- Complex reasoning (diagnosis, strategy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: Handles long-term goals, can reason about consequences  \n",
    "**Cons**: Planning overhead, requires good world model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Hybrid Architectures\n",
    "**How it works**: Combine reactive + deliberative: planner sets goals, reactive layer handles immediate responses and safety.  \n",
    "**Latency**: Mixed (fast reactions + slower planning in parallel)  \n",
    "**Complexity**: Moderate, but well-structured  \n",
    "**When to use**: Most modern assistants (balance responsiveness + reasoning)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: Responsive yet thoughtful, can interrupt planner for safety  \n",
    "**Cons**: More complex, harder to debug interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. LLM-Based Agent Architecture (Modern Split)\n",
    "**Planner (LLM)**: Reads state, emits plan (tool calls, subtasks, reasoning)  \n",
    "**Executor (Deterministic)**: Carries out tool calls, validates results, handles side effects  \n",
    "**Integration Loop**: Executor feeds results back to LLM for next decision\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "[LLM Planner] → \"I should call web_search, then summarize\"\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "[Tool Executor] → Runs web_search, collects results\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "[LLM Planner] → \"Now I'll summarize\" → emits answer\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "User Answer (with citations)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use**: Flexible, language-based reasoning required  \n",
    "**Pros**: Uses LLM's reasoning, auditable tool calls, repeatable  \n",
    "**Cons**: Latency (multiple LLM round-trips), cost (per-query LLM calls)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Framework: Which Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Best Choice | Why |\n",
    "|----------|------------|-----|\n",
    "| Stock trading bot (10ms latency) | Reactive | Speed critical |\n",
    "| Travel planner (\"book flight + hotel\") | Deliberative | Multi-step, constraints |\n",
    "| Customer support chatbot | Hybrid/LLM-based | Needs reactions + reasoning |\n",
    "| Robot navigating obstacles | Reactive layer + Planner | Safety + goal-seeking |\n",
    "| Code review assistant | LLM planner + tools | Language understanding + tool calls |\n",
    "| Game AI | Hybrid (planner for strategy, reactive for combat) | Balanced |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectural Considerations\n",
    "- **Error handling**: How to recover if a tool fails? Retry? Escalate? Replanning?\n",
    "- **Authorization**: Who can call which tools? Fine-grained access control?\n",
    "- **Observability**: Log every decision for debugging and audit trails\n",
    "- **Memory management**: What context to pass to the planner? Token limits?\n",
    "- **Feedback loops**: How does the agent learn from mistakes?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "❌ **Too much context** → LLM gets confused, slower  \n",
    "❌ **Too little context** → Agent misses important info  \n",
    "❌ **Unsafe tool permissions** → Agent calls dangerous tools  \n",
    "❌ **No error handling** → Agent stuck in infinite loop  \n",
    "❌ **Poor observability** → Can't debug why agent failed  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Pattern: Modular Stack\n",
    "```\n",
    "Perception Layer    ← User inputs, sensor data, API responses\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Memory/Context      ← Short-term & long-term memory\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Reasoning Engine    ← Planner, decision logic\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Tool/Action Layer   ← Executors, API clients\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Output/Feedback     ← User responses, logging, learning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer is replaceable: swap planners, tool sets, memory backends, etc."
