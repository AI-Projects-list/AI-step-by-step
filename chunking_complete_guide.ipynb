    "# 1. What is Chunking?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 What is Chunking?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking** is the process of breaking down large pieces of text or data into smaller, manageable segments called \"chunks\" while preserving meaning and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Chunking:**\n",
    "1. **Text Chunking**: Split documents into paragraphs, sentences, or fixed-size blocks\n",
    "2. **Linguistic Chunking**: Extract noun phrases, verb phrases (NLP)\n",
    "3. **Semantic Chunking**: Group by meaning, topics, or coherence\n",
    "4. **Data Chunking**: Process large datasets in batches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Document (10,000 words)\n",
    "    ↓ Chunk into paragraphs\n",
    "50 chunks (200 words each)\n",
    "    ↓ Process individually\n",
    "Embeddings, summaries, or analysis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Chunk Size**: Number of characters, words, tokens, or sentences\n",
    "- **Overlap**: Shared content between consecutive chunks\n",
    "- **Boundaries**: Where one chunk ends and another begins\n",
    "- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining meaning across chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why Use Chunking?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Handle Large Documents** - Process documents larger than model context limits\n",
    "2. **Memory Efficiency** - Avoid loading entire document into memory\n",
    "3. **Parallel Processing** - Process chunks independently and concurrently\n",
    "4. **Better Search/Retrieval** - Find relevant sections instead of whole documents\n",
    "5. **Improved Embeddings** - More focused, meaningful vector representations\n",
    "6. **Cost Optimization** - Pay only for relevant chunks in LLM APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Context Loss** - Information split across chunks may lose coherence\n",
    "2. **Boundary Issues** - Important content might be split awkwardly\n",
    "3. **Complexity** - Need to manage chunk relationships and metadata\n",
    "4. **Overhead** - Processing and merging chunks adds computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ When to Use Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Use When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. LLM Context Window Limitations**\n",
    "- Example: GPT-3.5 has 4,096 token limit, document is 50,000 tokens\n",
    "- Why: Must split document to fit in context window\n",
    "- Solution: Chunk into 4,000-token segments with 200-token overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Systems**\n",
    "- Example: Create Q&A system over company documentation\n",
    "- Why: Need to retrieve only relevant sections\n",
    "- Benefit: Faster retrieval, more accurate answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Large Document Processing**\n",
    "- Example: Analyze 500-page PDF report\n",
    "- Why: Can't process entire document at once\n",
    "- Use case: Extract insights from each chapter separately\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Semantic Search**\n",
    "- Example: Search across millions of articles\n",
    "- Why: Paragraph-level chunks give better precision\n",
    "- Benefit: Find exact relevant passage, not just document\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Memory-Constrained Environments**\n",
    "- Example: Process 10GB dataset on laptop with 8GB RAM\n",
    "- Why: Can't load entire dataset\n",
    "- Solution: Process in 100MB chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Streaming Data Processing**\n",
    "- Example: Analyze real-time logs from web server\n",
    "- Why: Continuous stream, can't wait for \"complete\" data\n",
    "- Use case: Process chunks as they arrive\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Fine-Tuning Data Preparation**\n",
    "- Example: Prepare training data for language model\n",
    "- Why: Models need fixed-size input sequences\n",
    "- Benefit: Create consistent training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Summarization of Long Documents**\n",
    "- Example: Summarize 100-page research paper\n",
    "- Why: Can't fit entire paper in summarization model\n",
    "- Solution: Summarize each section, then combine summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Don't Use When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Small Documents**\n",
    "- Problem: Overhead not worth it for 100-word text\n",
    "- Better: Process entire document directly\n",
    "- Why: Chunking adds complexity for no benefit\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Highly Interconnected Content**\n",
    "- Problem: Math proofs, code logic loses meaning when split\n",
    "- Better: Keep as single unit or use smart boundaries\n",
    "- Why: Context dependencies are critical\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Real-Time Low-Latency Needs**\n",
    "- Problem: Chunking adds processing time\n",
    "- Better: Use streaming without chunking\n",
    "- Why: Extra processing step increases latency\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. When Order Matters Critically**\n",
    "- Problem: Time-series data, narratives need sequence\n",
    "- Better: Process sequentially or use overlap\n",
    "- Why: Chunks may be processed out of order\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking Pipeline:**\n",
    "1. **Load Document**: Read text from file/database\n",
    "2. **Choose Strategy**: Fixed-size, sentence-based, semantic, etc.\n",
    "3. **Set Parameters**: Chunk size, overlap amount\n",
    "4. **Split Text**: Apply chunking algorithm\n",
    "5. **Add Metadata**: Track position, source, chunk ID\n",
    "6. **Process Chunks**: Embed, summarize, index, etc.\n",
    "7. **Store/Retrieve**: Save chunks for later use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Parameters:**\n",
    "- **chunk_size**: 500 tokens, 1000 characters, 3 sentences\n",
    "- **chunk_overlap**: 50 tokens (10% overlap)\n",
    "- **separator**: \"\\n\\n\", \".\", custom delimiter\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ChatGPT with Documents** - Chunk PDFs for Q&A over custom data\n",
    "2. **Google Search** - Index web pages in chunks for better retrieval\n",
    "3. **Legal Tech** - Analyze contracts section by section\n",
    "4. **Medical Research** - Process clinical trial documents by protocol sections\n",
    "5. **Customer Support** - Search knowledge base by article sections\n",
    "6. **Code Documentation** - Index API docs by function/class\n",
    "7. **E-Learning** - Break courses into digestible lessons\n",
    "8. **News Aggregation** - Process articles paragraph by paragraph\n",
    "9. **Academic Research** - Analyze papers by abstract/intro/methods/results\n",
    "10. **Financial Analysis** - Process quarterly reports by section\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Chunk size** is a tradeoff: too small loses context, too large loses focus  \n",
    "✅ **Overlap** helps preserve context across boundaries  \n",
    "✅ **Semantic chunking** (by meaning) often better than fixed-size  \n",
    "✅ **Sentence boundaries** are safer than mid-word splits  \n",
    "✅ **Metadata** (chunk position, source) is essential for reconstruction  \n",
    "✅ **Test different strategies** - optimal chunking is task-dependent  \n",
    "✅ **LLM chunking**: Use token count, not characters (tokenizers vary)  \n",
    "✅ **RAG systems**: 200-500 tokens per chunk is typical sweet spot  \n",
    "✅ **Hierarchical chunking**: Chunk at multiple levels (document → section → paragraph)  \n",
    "✅ **Always preserve** original document structure (headers, lists, code blocks)"

    "# 2. Fixed-Size Character Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 What is Fixed-Size Character Chunking?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed-size character chunking** splits text into chunks of exactly N characters, regardless of word or sentence boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chunk_size = 1000  # 1000 characters per chunk\n",
    "chunks = [text[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text: \"Hello world! This is amazing.\"\n",
    "Chunk size: 10 characters\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "  Chunk 1: \"Hello worl\"\n",
    "  Chunk 2: \"d! This is\"\n",
    "  Chunk 3: \" amazing.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why Use Fixed-Size Character Chunking?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Simplicity** - Easiest to implement (one line of code)\n",
    "2. **Predictability** - Always know exact chunk size\n",
    "3. **Speed** - Fastest chunking method (O(n))\n",
    "4. **Memory Efficient** - Minimal overhead\n",
    "5. **No Dependencies** - Pure Python, no libraries needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Breaks Words** - May split \"amazing\" into \"ama\" and \"zing\"\n",
    "2. **Breaks Sentences** - Loses semantic coherence\n",
    "3. **Context Loss** - Mid-word splits destroy meaning\n",
    "4. **Poor for NLP** - Most NLP tasks need complete words/sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ When to Use Fixed-Size Character Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Use When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Binary/Non-Text Data**\n",
    "- Example: Split log files, DNA sequences\n",
    "- Why: Content doesn't have semantic meaning\n",
    "- Benefit: Fast, simple processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Display/UI Constraints**\n",
    "- Example: Show max 500 characters in preview\n",
    "- Why: Hard limit on display area\n",
    "- Use case: Text truncation for UI\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Storage Limitations**\n",
    "- Example: Database field max 1000 chars\n",
    "- Why: Hard constraint from schema\n",
    "- Solution: Split before storing\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Quick Prototyping**\n",
    "- Example: Initial testing of chunking pipeline\n",
    "- Why: Fast to implement, test logic\n",
    "- Benefit: Can refine later\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Character-Level Models**\n",
    "- Example: Character-level RNN, transformer\n",
    "- Why: Model operates on characters anyway\n",
    "- Use case: Text generation at character level\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Don't Use When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. NLP Tasks**\n",
    "- Problem: Broken words/sentences lose meaning\n",
    "- Better: Use sentence or word chunking\n",
    "- Why: NLP needs complete linguistic units\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. LLM Processing**\n",
    "- Problem: Token boundaries don't align with characters\n",
    "- Better: Use token-based chunking\n",
    "- Why: Models tokenize differently (\"running\" vs \"run\"+\"##ning\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Search/Retrieval**\n",
    "- Problem: Partial words don't match queries\n",
    "- Better: Use semantic or sentence chunking\n",
    "- Why: \"amaz\" won't match \"amazing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Human Readability Required**\n",
    "- Problem: Mid-word splits are confusing\n",
    "- Better: Use paragraph or sentence chunking\n",
    "- Why: Humans need complete thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Start at position 0\n",
    "2. Extract `chunk_size` characters\n",
    "3. Move to position + `chunk_size`\n",
    "4. Repeat until end of text\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Overlap:**\n",
    "1. Start at position 0\n",
    "2. Extract `chunk_size` characters\n",
    "3. Move to position + `chunk_size` - `overlap`\n",
    "4. Repeat until end\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** O(n)  \n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log Processing** - Split log files into fixed blocks\n",
    "2. **DNA Sequencing** - Analyze genetic sequences in fixed windows\n",
    "3. **Binary Data** - Process binary files in chunks\n",
    "4. **Text Preview** - Truncate for UI display\n",
    "5. **File Transfer** - Split large files for network transmission\n",
    "6. **Database Storage** - Fit text into VARCHAR limits\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Simplest chunking method - use for prototyping  \n",
    "✅ Perfect for **non-semantic** content (logs, binary data)  \n",
    "✅ Add **overlap** to preserve some context  \n",
    "✅ Use `len(text.encode('utf-8'))` for byte size, not char count  \n",
    "✅ UTF-8 characters can be 1-4 bytes - be careful!  \n",
    "✅ Not suitable for **NLP or LLM tasks**  \n",
    "✅ Consider **smart chunking** as next step  \n",
    "✅ For production: use sentence or semantic chunking instead"
