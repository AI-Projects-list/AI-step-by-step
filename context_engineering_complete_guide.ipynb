    "# 1. What is Context Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 What is Context Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Engineering** (also called **Prompt Engineering**) is the practice of designing, structuring, and optimizing the input context provided to Large Language Models (LLMs) to elicit desired outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Components:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Context = System Message + User Input + Examples + Instructions + Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "  System Message = Model's role and behavior guidelines\n",
    "  User Input = Actual query or task\n",
    "  Examples = Few-shot demonstrations\n",
    "  Instructions = Task-specific directions\n",
    "  Constraints = Output format, length, style requirements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Context Window**: Maximum tokens the model can process (e.g., GPT-4: 128K tokens)\n",
    "- **Prompt Template**: Reusable structure for consistent interactions\n",
    "- **In-Context Learning**: Model learns from examples in the prompt\n",
    "- **Chain-of-Thought**: Guiding model through reasoning steps\n",
    "- **Grounding**: Anchoring responses to provided facts/documents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why Use Context Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **No Model Training** - Improve performance without fine-tuning\n",
    "2. **Immediate Results** - Changes take effect instantly\n",
    "3. **Cost-Effective** - Cheaper than training custom models\n",
    "4. **Flexibility** - Easily adapt to new tasks\n",
    "5. **Controllability** - Precise control over outputs\n",
    "6. **Transparency** - Instructions are human-readable\n",
    "7. **Iteration Speed** - Rapid experimentation and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenges:**\n",
    "1. **Token Limits** - Context window constraints\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity** - Small changes can drastically affect output\n",
    "3. **Prompt Injection** - Security vulnerabilities\n",
    "4. **Cost** - Large contexts consume more tokens\n",
    "5. **Latency** - Longer prompts increase response time\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ When to Use Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Use When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Adapting Pre-trained Models**\n",
    "- Example: Use GPT-4 for customer support without training\n",
    "- Why: Leverage existing capabilities via instructions\n",
    "- Benefit: Save months of training time and millions in compute\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Quick Prototyping**\n",
    "- Example: Test if LLM can classify support tickets\n",
    "- Why: Get results in minutes vs weeks for fine-tuning\n",
    "- Use case: POC, MVP development\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Small Dataset (< 1000 examples)**\n",
    "- Example: Classify rare medical conditions\n",
    "- Why: Few-shot learning works better than fine-tuning\n",
    "- Benefit: No need to collect thousands of training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Changing Requirements**\n",
    "- Example: Customer service bot with evolving policies\n",
    "- Why: Update prompts instantly vs re-training\n",
    "- Benefit: Agile adaptation to business needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Multi-Task Scenarios**\n",
    "- Example: Single model for summarization, Q&A, translation\n",
    "- Why: One prompt template per task\n",
    "- Benefit: Avoid maintaining multiple fine-tuned models\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Domain-Specific Tasks**\n",
    "- Example: Legal document analysis\n",
    "- Why: Provide domain context in prompt\n",
    "- Use case: Specialized knowledge without training\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Controlled Generation**\n",
    "- Example: Generate JSON output, specific format\n",
    "- Why: Constrain output via instructions\n",
    "- Benefit: Structured, parseable responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. RAG Systems**\n",
    "- Example: ChatGPT with company knowledge base\n",
    "- Why: Inject relevant documents into context\n",
    "- Benefit: Up-to-date information without retraining\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Don't Use When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Large Training Dataset Available**\n",
    "- Problem: 100K labeled examples for sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Better: Fine-tune a model\n",
    "- Why: Fine-tuning will outperform few-shot prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Latency-Critical Applications**\n",
    "- Problem: Real-time fraud detection (< 10ms)\n",
    "- Better: Specialized ML model\n",
    "- Why: LLM inference is too slow (100-1000ms)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Cost Constraints**\n",
    "- Problem: Millions of daily requests\n",
    "- Better: Fine-tuned smaller model\n",
    "- Why: API costs add up ($$ per 1M tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Privacy/Security Requirements**\n",
    "- Problem: Medical records, financial data\n",
    "- Better: On-premise fine-tuned model\n",
    "- Why: Avoid sending sensitive data to third-party APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Extremely Specialized Tasks**\n",
    "- Problem: Protein folding prediction\n",
    "- Better: Domain-specific model (AlphaFold)\n",
    "- Why: General LLMs lack specialized knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Flow:**\n",
    "1. **Design Prompt**: System message + instructions + examples\n",
    "2. **Add User Input**: Actual query or data\n",
    "3. **Send to LLM**: API call with full context\n",
    "4. **Receive Output**: Model generates response\n",
    "5. **Parse & Validate**: Extract and verify result\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Anatomy:**\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 🎯 Why Use Structured Prompts?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Consistency** - Repeatable results across queries\n",
    "2. **Clarity** - Model understands exactly what to do\n",
    "3. **Debugging** - Easy to identify which part fails\n",
    "4. **Reusability** - Create templates for common tasks\n",
    "5. **Quality Control** - Reduces hallucination and errors\n",
    "6. **Maintainability** - Update specific sections easily\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ When to Use Basic Prompt Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Use When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Production Systems**\n",
    "- Example: Customer support chatbot\n",
    "- Why: Need consistent, reliable responses\n",
    "- Structure ensures quality at scale\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Complex Tasks**\n",
    "- Example: Multi-step data extraction\n",
    "- Why: Break down into clear steps\n",
    "- Structure prevents confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Team Collaboration**\n",
    "- Example: Multiple developers using same prompts\n",
    "- Why: Standard format improves collaboration\n",
    "- Benefit: Everyone follows same pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Testing & Iteration**\n",
    "- Example: A/B testing different instructions\n",
    "- Why: Change one component at a time\n",
    "- Benefit: Isolate what improves performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Automated Workflows**\n",
    "- Example: Daily report generation\n",
    "- Why: Template ensures consistent output format\n",
    "- Benefit: Downstream systems can parse reliably\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Don't Need When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Simple Queries**\n",
    "- Example: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "- Better: Just ask directly\n",
    "- Why: No need to over-engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. One-Off Tasks**\n",
    "- Example: Quick translation for personal use\n",
    "- Better: Simple, informal prompt\n",
    "- Why: Not worth the overhead\n",

    "## 💡 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use delimiters** - Separate sections with ###, ---, ``` for clarity  \n",
    "✅ **Be explicit** - State obvious things (\"Output JSON only\")  \n",
    "✅ **Order matters** - Put most important info first and last  \n",
    "✅ **Test variations** - Try different orderings of sections  \n",
    "✅ **Use numbered steps** - Better than prose for instructions  \n",
    "✅ **Specify output first** - Show format before asking question  \n",
    "✅ **Version control** - Track prompt changes like code  \n",
    "✅ **Document intent** - Comment why each section exists  \n",
    "✅ **Measure impact** - Test each component's contribution"
